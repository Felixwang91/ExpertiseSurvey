\chapter{Conclusion}

In this study, we reviewed 48 primary studies about expertise location approaches and systems in the field of Software Engineering and Computer Supported Collaborative Work. We found that the conclusions in software engineering are similar to early cognitive research on expert performance. Moreover, we found several categories of expertise location approaches and systems measuring the expertise level based on the previous experience of developers which results in a disconnect between early cognitive expertise research and automated location techniques in Software Engineering practice. Further, we found the granularity of model for measuring expertise in these location techniques tend to be more focused on micro low-level tasks over the years, and it is challenging to evaluate the measurement of expertise and location approach in the real-world context. Finally, we conclude our findings and provide a series of discussions on future directions for expertise location studies in Software Engineering.
