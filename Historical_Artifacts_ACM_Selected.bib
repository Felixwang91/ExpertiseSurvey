Although contributors' knowledge building has been repeatedly found to facilitate their project continuance, FLOSS projects are lacking operational advices on how to assist their members' learning. Drawing on previous literature which emphasizes project members' social interactions and their practical experiences to build new knowledge, we propose mentoring as a training method for FLOSS projects.

Ownership and ownership awareness are also issues in open-source software (OSS) projects. Indeed, the membership in OSS projects is dynamic with team members arriving and leaving. In large open source projects, specialists who know the system very well are considered experts. How can one identify the experts in a project by mining a particular repository like the source code? Have they gotten help from other people? We provide an approach using classification of the source code tree as a path to derive the expertise of the committers. Because committers may get help from other people, we also retrieve their contributors. We also provide a visualization that helps to further explore the repository via committers and categories. We present a prototype implementation that describes our research using the Apache HTTP Web server project as a case study.},

In this paper, we propose a code reviewer recommendation technique that considers not only the relevant cross-project work history (e.g., external library experience) but also the experience of a developer in certain specialized technologies associated with a pull request for determining her expertise as a potential code reviewer. We first motivate our technique using an exploratory study with 10 commercial projects and 10 associated libraries external to those projects. Experiments using 17,115 pull requests from 10 commercial projects and six open source projects show that our technique provides 85\%-- 92\% recommendation accuracy, about 86\% precision and 79\%--81\% recall in code reviewer recommendation, which are highly promising. Comparison with the state-of-the-art technique also validates the empirical findings and the superiority of our recommendation technique.},

A developer gains expertise on the code base as well as the domain of the software system he/she develops. This information forms a useful input in allocating software implementation tasks to developers. Domain concepts represented by the system are discovered by taking into account the linguistic information available in the source code. The vocabulary contained in source code as identifiers such as class, method, variable names and comments are extracted. Concepts present in the code base are identified and grouped based on a well known text processing hypothesis - words are similar to the extent to which they share similar words. The developer's association with the source code and the concepts it represents is arrived at using the version repository information. In this line, the analysis first derives documents from source code by discarding all the programming language constructs. KMeans clustering is further used to cluster documents and extract closely related concepts. The key concepts present in the documents authored by the developer determine his/her domain expertise. To validate our approach we apply it on large software systems, two of which are presented in detail in this paper.},

In this paper we propose recommender system for expert location with the aim to reduce delays of finding the right person whenever somebody needs assistance during coding.

The aim is to discover runtime process, analyze performance and perform conformance verification, using process mining tools like ProM and Disco, for single software repository and processes spanning across multiple repositories. Application of process mining to software repositories has recently gained interest due to availability of vast data generated during software development and maintenance. Process data are embodied in repositories which can be used for analysis to improve the efficiency and capability of process, however, involves a lot of challenges which have not been addressed so far. Project team defines workflow, design process and policies for tasks like issue tracking (defect or feature enhancement), peer code review (review the submitted patch to avoid defects before they are injected) etc. to streamline and structure the activities. The reality may not be the same as defined because of imperfections so the extent of non-conformance needs to be measured. We propose a research framework `Nirikshan' to process mine the data of software repositories from multiple perspectives like process, organizational, data and time. We apply process mining on software repositories to derive runtime process map, identify and remove inefficiencies and imperfections, extend the capabilities of existing software engineering tools to make them more process aware, and understand interaction pattern between various contributors to improve the efficiency of project.},

We introduce a degree-of-knowledge model that computes automatically, for each source-code element in a codebase, a real value that represents a developer's knowledge of that element based on a developer's authorship and interaction data. We present evidence that shows that both authorship and interaction data of the code are important in characterizing a developer's knowledge of code. We report on the usage of our model in case studies on expert finding, knowledge transfer, and identifying changes of interest. We show that our model improves upon an existing expertise-finding approach and can accurately identify changes for which a developer should likely be aware. We discuss how our model may provide a starting point for knowledge transfer but that more refinement is needed. Finally, we discuss the robustness of the model across multiple development sites.},

	abstract = {Context: Expert identification is becoming critical to ease the communication between developers in case of global software development or to better know members of large software communities. To quickly identify who are the experts that will best perform a given development task, both the assignment of skills to developers and the computation of their corresponding expertise level have to be automated. Since the real level of expertise is tedious to assess, our challenge is to identify developers having a significant level of experience with respect to a skill. Method: In this paper we propose XTic, an approach that takes up this challenge with the intent to be accurate and efficient. XTic provides a language to specify skills. It also provides an automatic process that extracts skills and experience levels from source code repositories. Our approach is based on the idea that an expert has a high level of experience with respect to a skill. Results: We have validated XTic both on open source and industrial projects to measure its accuracy and its efficiency. The results we obtained show that its accuracy is between moderate and strong and that it scales well with medium and large size software projects. Conclusion: XTic supports the specification of a diversity of developer skills and the extraction of the expertise of these developers under the form of level of experience.},

Unfortunately, at GitHub, identifying an appropriate code reviewer for a pull request is challenging given that reliable information for reviewer identification is often not readily available. In this paper, we propose a code reviewer recommendation tool-CORRECT-that considers not only the relevant cross-project work experience (e.g., external library experience) of a developer but also her experience in certain specialized technologies (e.g., Google App Engine) associated with a pull request for determining her expertise as a potential code reviewer. We design our tool using client-server architecture, and then package the solution as a Google Chrome plug-in. Once the developer initiates a new pull request at GitHub, our tool automatically analyzes the request, mines two relevant histories, and then returns a ranked list of appropriate code reviewers for the request within the browser's context.

In large-scale online community, recommending expert collaborators to a project coordinator or lead developer has two prominent challenges: (i) the "cold shoulder"' problem, which is the lack of interest from the experts to collaborate and share their skills, and (ii) the "cold start" problem, which is an issue with community members who has scarce data history. In this paper, we consider the Degree of Knowledge (DoK) which imposes the knowledge of the skills factor, and the Social Relative Importance (SRI) which imposes the social distance factor to tackle the aforementioned challenges. We propose four DoK models and integrate them with three SRI methods under our proposed Expert Ranking (ER) framework to rank the candidate expert collaborators based on their likelihood of collaborating in response to a query formulated by the social network of a query initiator and certain required skills to a project/task. We evaluate our proposal using a dataset collected from Github.com, which is one of the most fast-growing, large-scale online OSS community. In addition, we test the models under different data scarcity levels. The experiment shows promising results of recommending expert collaborators who tend to make real collaborations to projects.},

	abstract = {In a traditional sense, ownership determines rights and duties in regard to an object, for example a property. The owner of source code usually refers to the person that invented the code. However, larger code artifacts, such as files, are usually composed by multiple engineers contributing to the entity over time through a series of changes. Frequently, the person with the highest contribution, e.g. the most number of code changes, is defined as the code owner and takes responsibility for it. Thus, code ownership relates to the knowledge engineers have about code. Lacking responsibility and knowledge about code can reduce code quality. In an earlier study, Bird et al. [1] showed that Windows binaries that lacked clear code ownership were more likely to be defect prone. However recommendations for large artifacts such as binaries are usually not actionable. E.g. changing the concept of binaries and refactoring them to ensure strong ownership would violate system architecture principles. A recent replication study by Foucault et al. [2] on open source software replicate the original results and lead to doubts about the general concept of ownership impacting code quality. In this paper, we replicated and extended the previous two ownership studies [1, 2] and reflect on their findings. Further, we define several new ownership metrics to investigate the dependency between ownership and code quality on file and directory level for 4 major Microsoft products. The results confirm the original findings by Bird et al. [1] that code ownership correlates with code quality. Using new and refined code ownership metrics we were able to classify source files that contained at least one bug with a median precision of 0.74 and a median recall of 0.38. On directory level, we achieve a precision of 0.76 and a recall of 0.60.},

Goal: Understand the mechanisms at work when knowledge is transferred during a pair programming session; provide practical advice for constructive behavior. Method: Qualitative data analysis of recordings of actual industrial pair programming sessions. Results: Some pairs are much more efficient in their knowledge transfer than others. These pairs manage to (1) not attempt to explain multiple things at once, (2) not lose sight of a topic, (3) clarify difficult points in stages. Conclusions: Pair programming requires skill beyond software development skill. To be able to identify knowledge needs and then push such knowledge to or pull it from the partner successfully is one aspect of such skill. We characterize a number of its elements.},

For this reason, tools for measuring the amount of spread of knowledge within a team (i.e. the Truck factor) and identifying possible Heroes are welcomed. In this paper, we have implemented a tool to compute the Truck factor and identify Heroes in a project. To assess the applicability and usefulness of the tool we have applied it to 20 randomly selected FLOSS projects. Preliminary results are encouraging: the approach seems to be applicable and useful. We found that Heroes are common in the considered set of FLOSS projects and that the Truck factor is in general low.},

To facilitate this collaboration, specialized tools, such as chat and screen sharing, are being integrated into development environments. Currently, these tools require a developer to maintain a list of other developers with whom they may wish to communicate and to determine who within this list has expertise for a specific situation. For large, dynamic projects, like several successful open-source projects, these requirements place an unreasonable burden on the developer. In this paper, we show how the structure of a team emerges from how developers change software artifacts. We introduce the Emergent Expertise Locator (EEL) that uses emergent team information to propose experts to a developer within their development environment as the developer works. We found that EEL produces, on average, results with higher precision and higher recall than an existing heuristic for expertise recommendation.},

We also empirically identify reasons that low-expertise developers make changes to components and show that the removal of low-expertise contributions dramatically decreases the performance of contribution based defect prediction.

A tool for ranking all the source files of a project with respect to how likely they are to contain the cause of the bug would enable developers to narrow down their search and potentially could lead to a substantial increase in productivity. This paper introduces an adaptive ranking approach that leverages domain knowledge through functional decompositions of source code files into methods, API descriptions of library components used in the code, the bug-fixing history, and the code change history. Given a bug report, the ranking score of each source file is computed as a weighted combination of an array of features encoding domain knowledge, where the weights are trained automatically on previously solved bug reports using a learning-to-rank technique. We evaluated our system on six large scale open source Java projects, using the before-fix version of the project for every bug report. The experimental results show that the newly introduced learning-to-rank approach significantly outperforms two recent state-of-the-art methods in recommending relevant files for bug reports. In particular, our method makes correct recommendations within the top 10 ranked source files for over 70\% of the bug reports in the Eclipse Platform and Tomcat projects.},

Besides sharing code, Github is also a social network, in which developers can follow others or keep track of their interested projects.

In this paper, we propose GEMiner, a novel approach to identify experts for some specific programming languages in Github. Different from previous approaches, GEMiner analyzes the social behaviors and programming behaviors of a developer to determine the expertise of the developer. When modeling social behaviors of developers, to integrate heterogenous social networks in Github, GEMiner implements a Multi-Sources PageRank algorithm. Also, GEMiner analyzes the behaviors of developers when they are programming (e.g., their commit activities and their preferred programming languages) to model programming behaviors of them. Based on our expertise models and our extracted programming languages data, GEMiner can then identify experts for some specific programming languages in Github. We conducted experiments on a real data set, and our results show that GEMiner identifies experts with 60\% accuracy higher than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

We observed, interviewed, and surveyed developers and managers and manually classified hundreds of review comments across diverse teams at Microsoft. Our study reveals that while finding defects remains the main motivation for review, reviews are less about defects than expected and instead provide additional benefits such as knowledge transfer, increased team awareness, and creation of alternative solutions to problems. Moreover, we find that code and change understanding is the key aspect of code reviewing and that developers employ a wide range of mechanisms to meet their understanding needs, most of which are not met by current tools.

In this paper, we report on an empirical study that investigates whether a programmer's activity can be used to build a model of what a programmer knows about a code base. In this study, nineteen professional Java programmers completed a series of questionnaires about the code on which they were working. These questionnaires were generated automatically and asked about program elements a programmer had worked with frequently and recently and ones that he had not. We found that a degree of interest model based on this frequency and recency of interaction can often indicate the parts of the code base for which the programmer has knowledge. We also determined a number of factors that may be used to improve the model, such as authorship of program elements, the role of elements, and the task being performed.},

	abstract = {The change history of a software project contains a rich collection of code changes that record previous development experience. Changes that fix bugs are especially interesting, since they record both the old buggy code and the new fixed code. This paper presents a bug finding algorithm using bug fix memories: a project-specific bug and fix knowledge base developed by analyzing the history of bug fixes. A bug finding tool, BugMem, implements the algorithm. The approach is different from bug finding tools based on theorem proving or static model checking such as Bandera, ESC/Java, FindBugs, JLint, and PMD. Since these tools use pre-defined common bug patterns to find bugs, they do not aim to identify project-specific bugs. Bug fix memories use a learning process, so the bug patterns are project-specific, and project-specific bugs can be detected. The algorithm and tool are assessed by evaluating if real bugs and fixes in project histories can be found in the bug fix memories. Analysis of five open source projects shows that, for these projects, 19.3\%-40.3\% of bugs appear repeatedly in the memories, and 7.9\%-15.5\% of bug and fix pairs are found in memories. The results demonstrate that project-specific bug fix patterns occur frequently enough to be useful as a bug detection technique. Furthermore, for the bug and fix pairs, it is possible to both detect the bug and provide a strong suggestion for the fix. However, there is also a high false positive rate, with 20.8\%-32.5\% of non-bug containing changes also having patterns found in the memories. A comparison of BugMem with a bug finding tool, PMD, shows that the bug sets identified by both tools are mostly exclusive, indicating that BugMem complements other bug finding tools.},

Thus far, there has been little work to recommend developers who have the right expertise to perform a branch integration. We propose TIPMerge, a novel tool that recommends developers who are best suited to perform merges, by taking into consideration developers’ past experience in the project, their changes in the branches, and de-pendencies among modified files in the branches. We evaluated TIPMerge on 28 projects, which included up to 15,584 merges with at least two developers, and potentially conflicting changes. On average, 85\% of the top-3 recommendations by TIPMerge correctly included the developer who performed the merge. Best (accuracy) results of recommendations were at 98\%. Our inter-views with developers of two projects reveal that in cases where the TIPMerge recommendation did not match the actual merge developer, the recommended developer had the expertise to per-form the merge, or was involved in a collaborative merge session.},

The information available on this type of service is also known as "crowd knowledge" and currently is one important trend in supporting activities related to software development and maintenance.   We present an approach that makes use of "crowd knowledge" available in SO to recommend information that can assist developers in their activities. This strategy recommends a ranked list of pairs of questions/answers from SO based on a query (list of terms). The ranking criteria is based on two main aspects: the textual similarity of the pairs with respect to the query (the developer's problem) and the quality of the pairs. Moreover, we developed a classifier to consider only "how-to" posts. We conducted an experiment considering programming problems on three different topics (Swing, Boost and LINQ) widely used by the software development community to evaluate the proposed recommendation strategy. The results have shown that for 77.14\% of the assessed activities, at least one recommended pair proved to be useful concerning the target programming problem. Moreover, for all activities, at least one recommended pair had a source code snippet considered reproducible or almost reproducible.},

Software companies resort to costly training camps or mentoring initiatives. Not overcoming this lack of testing skills early on can hinder the newcomer’s professional progress in becoming a high-quality engineer. Studying open source developers, we found that they rely on a project’s pre-existing test code to learn how to write tests and adapt test code for their own use. We propose to strategically present useful and contextual test code examples from a project’s test suite to newcomers in order to facilitate learning and test writing. With an automatic suggestion mechanism for valuable test code, the newcomer is enabled to learn how senior developers write tests and copy it. Having access to suitable tests lowers the barrier for writing new tests.},

However, there is a significant amount of human effort involved even in tool based code reviews. Using static analysis tools, it is possible to reduce the human effort by automating the checks for coding standard violations and common defect patterns. Towards this goal, we propose a tool called Review Bot for the integration of automatic static analysis with the code review process. Review Bot uses output of multiple static analysis tools to publish reviews automatically. Through a user study, we show that integrating static analysis tools with code review process can improve the quality of code review. The developer feedback for a subset of comments from automatic reviews shows that the developers agree to fix 93\% of all the automatically generated comments. There is only 14.71\% of all the accepted comments which need improvements in terms of priority, comment message, etc. Another problem with tool assisted code review is the assignment of appropriate reviewers. Review Bot solves this problem by generating reviewer recommendations based on change history of source code lines. Our experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy is in the range of 60\%-92\%, which is significantly better than a comparable method based on file change history.},

However comparatively little research has been carried out to date on this topic in general, and more notably, on agile methods in particular. This dearth of evidence in the case of agile methods is especially significant in that it is reasonable to expect that such methods would particularly lend themselves to tailoring. In this research, we present a framework based on interviews with 20 senior software development researchers and a review of the extant literature. The framework is comprised of two sets of factors—characteristics of the method, and developer practices—that can improve method tailoring effectiveness. Drawing on the framework, we then interviewed 16 expert XP practitioners to examine the current state and effectiveness of XP tailoring efforts, and to shed light on issues the framework identified as being important. The article concludes with a set of recommendations for research and practice that would advance our understanding of the method tailoring area.},

Due to the time-consumption of PR review and the diversity of PR aspects, it is becoming a big challenge for core developers to quickly discover the useful PR. Currently, recommending appropriate reviewers (developers) for incoming PR to quickly collect meaningful comments, is treated as an effective and crowdsourced way to help core developers to make decisions and thus accelerate project development. In this paper, we propose a reviewer recommendation approach (EARec) which simultaneously considers developer expertise and authority. Specifically, we first construct a graph of incoming PR and possible reviewers, and then take advantage of text similarity of PR and social relations of reviewers to find the appropriate reviewers. The experimental analysis on MSR Mining Challenge Dataset provides good evaluation for our approach in terms of precision and recall.},

Method: We propose a novel problem formulation, DCW-DS, and an analytics-based decision support methodology to guide workers in acceptance of offered development tasks. DCS-DS is evaluated using more than one year's real-world data from TopCoder, the leading CSD platform. Results: Applying Random Forest based machine learning with dynamic updates, we can predict a worker as being a likely quitter with 99\% average precision and 99\% average recall accuracy. Similarly, we achieved 78\% average precision and 88\% average recall for the worker winner class. For workers just following the top three task recommendations, we have shown that the average quitting rate goes down below 6\%. Conclusions: In total, the proposed method can be used to improve total success rate as well as reduce quitting rate of tasks performed.},

The tool enables developers, for example, easily to distinguish someone who has worked only briefly in a particular area of the code from someone who has more extensive experience, and to locate people with broad expertise throughout large parts of the product, such as module or even subsystems. In addition, it allows a user to discover expertise profiles for individuals or organizations. Data from a deployment of the tool in a large software development organization shows that newer, remote sites tend to use the tool for expertise location more frequently. Larger, more established sites used the tool to find expertise profiles for people or organizations.

These dependencies create a need for communication and coordination that requires continuous effort by software developers. Empirical studies, including our own, suggest that technical dependencies among software components create social dependencies among the software developers implementing these components. Based on this observation, we developed Ariadne, a Java plug-in for Eclipse. Ariadne analyzes a Java project to identify program dependencies and collects authorship information about the project by connecting to a configuration management repository. Through this process, Ariadne can "translate" technical dependencies among software components into social dependencies among software developers. This paper describes the design of Ariadne, how it identifies technical dependencies among software components, how it extracts information from configuration management systems and, finally, how it translates this into social dependencies. Ariadne's purpose is to create a bridge between technical and social dependencies.},

To this end, a social network has to be defined in a suitable way, and appropriate analysis strategies have to be chosen.

	abstract = {Users’ online behaviors such as ratings and examination of items are recognized as one of the most valuable sources of information for learning users’ preferences in order to make personalized recommendations. But most previous works focus on modeling only one type of users’ behaviors such as numerical ratings or browsing records, which are referred to as explicit feedback and implicit feedback, respectively. In this article, we study a Semisupervised Collaborative Recommendation (SSCR) problem with labeled feedback (for explicit feedback) and unlabeled feedback (for implicit feedback), in analogy to the well-known Semisupervised Learning (SSL) setting with labeled instances and unlabeled instances. SSCR is associated with two fundamental challenges, that is, heterogeneity of two types of users’ feedback and uncertainty of the unlabeled feedback. As a response, we design a novel Self-Transfer Learning (sTL) algorithm to iteratively identify and integrate likely positive unlabeled feedback, which is inspired by the general forward/backward process in machine learning. The merit of sTL is its ability to learn users’ preferences from heterogeneous behaviors in a joint and selective manner. We conduct extensive empirical studies of sTL and several very competitive baselines on three large datasets. The experimental results show that our sTL is significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Software development teams must be properly structured to provide effectiv collaboration to produce quality software. Over the last several years, social network analysis (SNA) has emerged as a popular method for studying the collaboration and organization of people working in large software development teams. Researchers have been modeling networks of developers based on socio-technical connections found in software development artifacts. Using these developer networks, researchers have proposed several SNA metrics that can predict software quality factors and describe the team structure. But do SNA metrics measure what they purport to measure? The objective of this research is to investigate if SNA metrics represent socio-technical relationships by examining if developer networks can be corroborated with developer perceptions. To measure developer perceptions, we developed an online survey that is personalized to each developer of a development team based on that developer's SNA metrics. Developers answered questions about other members of the team, such as identifying their collaborators and the project experts. A total of 124 developers responded to our survey from three popular open source projects: the Linux kernel, the PHP programming language, and the Wireshark network protocol analyzer. Our results indicate that connections in the developer network are statistically associated with the collaborators whom the developers named. Our results substantiate that SNA metrics represent socio-technical relationships in open source development projects, while also clarifying how the developer network can be interpreted by researchers and practitioners.},

In prior work we proposed a system for creating a social network of developers centered around the APIs they use in order to recommend people and projects they might be interested in. The implementation of such a system requires analyzing code from repositories of large numbers of projects that use different build systems. Hence, one challenge is to determine the APIs referenced in code in these repositories without relying on the ability to resolve every project's external dependencies. In this paper, we consider a technique called Partial Program Analysis for resolving type bindings in Java source code in the absence of third-party library binaries. Another important design decision concerns the approach of associating such API references with the developers who authored them such as walking entire change history or use blame information. We evaluate these different design options on 4 open-source Java projects and found that both Partial Program Analysis and blame-based approach provide precision greater than 80\%. However, use of blame as opposed to complete program history leads to significant recall loss, in most cases greater than 40\%.},

Method: We replicate two recent defect prediction studies comparing different data sets and learning algorithms, and report missing information and problems. Results: Even with access to the original data sets, replicating previous studies may not lead to the exact same results. The choice of evaluation procedures, performance measures and presentation has a large influence on the reproducibility. Additionally, we show that trivial and random models can be used to identify overly optimistic evaluation measures. Conclusions: The best way to conduct easily reproducible studies is to share all associated artifacts, e.g. scripts and programs used.

	abstract = {Despite their proven benefits, useful, comprehensible, and efficiently checkable specifications are not widely available. This is primarily because writing useful, non-trivial specifications from scratch is too hard, time consuming, and requires expertise that is not broadly available. Furthermore, the lack of specifications for widely-used libraries and frameworks, caused by the high cost of writing specifications, tends to have a snowball effect. Core libraries lack specifications, which makes specifying applications that use them expensive. To contain the skyrocketing development and maintenance costs of high assurance systems, this self-perpetuating cycle must be broken. The labor cost of specifying programs can be significantly decreased via advances in specification inference and synthesis, and this has been attempted several times, but with limited success. We believe that practical specification inference and synthesis is an idea whose time has come. Fundamental breakthroughs in this area can be achieved by leveraging the collective intelligence available in software artifacts from millions of open source projects. Finegrained access to such data sets has been unprecedented, but is now easily available. We identify research directions and report our preliminary results on advances in specification inference that can be had by using such data sets to infer specifications.},

	abstract = {With a great number of software applications that have been developed, software maintenance has become an important and challenging task, particularly due to the increasing scale of software projects. Even if developers can create and update bug reports in bug repositories to support software maintenance, a large software project receives a large number of bug reports each day. For reducing the workload of developers, many researchers and software engineers have begun recommending appropriate developers to fix bugs. This process is called bug triage and is a hot research topic for software maintenance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid bug triage algorithm, combining a probability model and an experience model to rank all candidate developers for fixing a new bug. For this study, we adopted the smoothed Unigram Model (UM) instead of the traditional Vector Space Model (VSM) to search similar bug reports. In the probability model, we used a social network to analyze the probability of fixing a new bug for a candidate developer. We first proposed to add a new feature (the number of re-opened bugs) in order to get the fixing probability. In the experience model, we considered the number of fixed bugs and fixing cost for each candidate developer as the estimate factor. In addition, we introduced a new concept, activity factor, to better model developers' experience. We performed the experiments on two large-scale, open source projects. The results show that our method can effectively recommend the best developer for fixing bugs.},

We analyzed 70 interview evaluations from 9 software companies. Using a grounded theory approach, we compared interviewer interpretations of criteria including: performing a problem solving walkthrough, applying previous experience to problem solving, and the ability to engaging in conversation beyond writing code. From these findings, we provide implications on what candidates can expect to be evaluated on during technical interviews across companies, which can sometimes vary significantly.},

Aims: This paper proposes a new approach, called DRETOM (Developer REcommendation based on TOpic Models), to recommending developers for bug resolution in collaborative behavior. Method: The proposed approach models developers' interest in and expertise on bug resolving activities based on topic models that are built from their historical bug resolving records. Given a new bug report, DRETOM recommends a ranked list of developers who are potential to participate in and contribute to resolving the new bug according to these developers' interest in and expertise on resolving it. Results: Experimental results on Eclipse JDT and Mozilla Firefox projects show that DRETOM can achieve high recall up to 82\% and 50\% with top 5 and top 7 recommendations respectively. Conclusion: Developers' interest in bug resolving activities should be taken into consideration. On condition that the parameter θ of DRETOM is set properly with trials, the proposed approach is practically useful in terms of recall.},

The ERSF first looks for other developers with similar technical expertise, as measured by their prior work on code fragments that are similar to (clones of) the code that the Active Developer is working on (the "code at hand"). As well, it analyzes the other developers' social relationships with the Active Developer (available from the DSSD environment) and their social activities within the ERSF (information which helps to maintain developer profiles used in this analysis). This information is then combined to provide a ranked list of potential helpers based on both technical and social measures. A proof of concept experiment shows that the ERSF can recommend experts with good to excellent accuracy, when compared with human rankings of appropriate experts in the same scenarios},

We pose research questions and suggest future work to explore the motivations of programmers that contribute to Q\&A websites, and to understand the implications of turning Q\&A exchanges into technical mini-blogs through the editing of questions and answers.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new technique, which automatically selects the most appropriate developers for fixing the fault represented by a failing test case, and provides a diagnosis of where to look for the fault. This technique works by incorporating three key components: (1) fault localization to inform locations whose execution correlate with failure, (2) history mining to inform which developers edited each line of code and when, and (3) expertise assignment to map locations to developers. To our knowledge, the technique is the first to assign developers to execution failures, without the need for textual bug reports. We implement this technique in our tool, WhoseFault, and describe an experiment where we utilize a large, open-source project to determine the frequency in which our tool suggests an assignment to the actual developer who fixed the fault. Our results show that 81\% of the time, WhoseFault produced the same developer that actually fixed the fault within the top three suggestions. We also show that our technique improved by a difference between 4\% and 40\% the results of a baseline technique. Finally, we explore the influence of each of the three components of our technique over its results, and compare our expertise algorithm against an existing expertise assessment technique and find that our algorithm provides greater accuracy, by up to 37\%.},

We analyzed the current literature and found that most of the current evaluations rely on artificial queries extracted from released code, which begs the question: Do such evaluations reflect real-life usages? To answer this question, we capture 6,189 fine-grained development histories from real IDE interactions. We use them as a ground truth and extract 7,157 real queries for a specific method-call recommender system. We compare the results of such real queries with different artificial evaluation strategies and check several assumptions that are repeatedly used in research, but never empirically evaluated. We find that an evolving context that is often observed in practice has a major effect on the prediction quality of recommender systems, but is not commonly reflected in artificial evaluations.},

Software is being developed for an increasingly diverse set of applications and user populations, each with different characteristics and development constraints. As a consequence, researchers and practitioners have begun to realize the importance of identifying and understanding the characteristics and special development needs of application domains. This paper presents a method for developing and refining knowledge about application domains by creating a repository of project experiences. Subsequent projects can then benefit from these experiences by locating similar projects and reusing the knowledge accumulated in the repository. We develop a framework for a system to capture relationships between development projects and resources for developing software, including process models, methods, technologies, and tools. We then show how this information can be reused to improve the productivity and quality of software development efforts.},

However, the prohibitively large cost of the pair-wise comparison method prevents it from being applied to large test suites. In this paper, we introduce a cluster-based test case prioritisation technique. By clustering test cases, based on their dynamic runtime behaviour, we can reduce the required number of pair-wise comparisons significantly. The approach is evaluated on seven test suites ranging in size from 154 to 1,061 test cases. We present an empirical study that shows that the resulting prioritisation is more effective than existing coverage-based prioritisation techniques in terms of rate of fault detection. Perhaps surprisingly, the paper also demonstrates that clustering (even without human input) can outperform unclustered coverage-based technologies, and discusses an automated process that can be used to determine whether the application of the proposed approach would yield improvement.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Software testing can be an arduous and expensive activity. A typical activity to maximise testing productivity is to allocate test cases according to the testers' profile. However, optimising the allocation of manual test cases is not a trivial task: in big companies, test managers are responsible for allocating hundreds of test cases among several testers. OBJECTIVE: In this paper we propose and evaluate 2 assignment algorithms for test case allocation and 3 tester profiles based on recommender systems. Each assignment algorithm can be combined with 3 tester profiles, which results in six possible allocation systems. METHOD: We run a controlled experiment that uses 100 test suites, each one with at least 50 test cases, from a real industrial setting in order to compare our allocation systems to the manager's allocation in terms of precision, recall and unassignment (percentage of test cases the algorithm could not allocate). RESULTS: In our experiment, the statistical analysis shows that one of the systems outperforms the others with respect to the precision and recall metrics. For unassignment, three of our six allocation systems achieved zero (best value) for the unassignment rate. CONCLUSION: The results of our experiment suggest that, in similar environments, test managers can use our allocation systems to reduce the amount of time spent in the test case allocation task. In the real industrial setting in which our work was developed, managers spend from 16 to 30 working days a year on test case allocation. Our algorithms can help them do it faster and better.},

Its popularity is mainly attributed to the timely answers provided by a great number of developers. When having problems in learning and using new technologies, developers resort to Stack Overflow for help. However, it is difficult to recommend questions to the potential answerers due to the huge numbers of questions. In order to improve the accuracy of question recommending, we need to find out the members who are interested in the fields related to the questions and match the ability of developers with the difficulty of questions. To do so, we need to pay close attention to the behavior of developers. This paper presents a model with two prediction approaches, namely, the traditional feature-based approach and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) based approach. When a new question arrives, this model will use LDA method to label the question and indicate the proper category to which the question belongs according to latent semantic feature and content feature. Then, with the traditional features of the question and the asker information, the model will recommend the appropriate developers to answer this new question.},

Method: We performed a survey with professional software engineers working in different commercial software companies in Brazil. We sent invitations to just over 150 professionals and received 77 valid answers from participants working in 35 distinct software companies. We measured 21 work design constructs, as well as job burnout, role conflict, role ambiguity, and two constructs related to job rotation. Results: Comparisons of our sample with other sample consisting of a diversity of professions showed that software engineering work has distinct characteristics, but some results require further investigation. Conclusion: We identified relevant characteristics of software engineering work and areas for further research.

This research identifies two gaps in this field: a lack of understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms that intervene with the information systems development (ISD) process, and a lack of understanding of knowledge structures between user participants and system developers that may shape the effectiveness of team processes. To fill up the two gaps, I propose a knowledge perspective of user participation and identify two types of knowledge interactions between user participants and system developers, knowledge acquisition and knowledge exploitation, as main team processes that mediate the relationship between user participation and team performance. In addition, I assimilate recent advances in the filed of collective cognition. Major implications of this study are that user participation may not be effective if participants cannot contribute knowledge to the ISD process, or their knowledge cannot be successfully acquired and utilized by the ISD project team; and team cognition, specified here as transactive memory systems and shared mental models, will shape the effects of knowledge interactions between users and system developers, thereby indirectly influencing the performance of the ISD project team. A theoretical model is also provided.},
